# Airline Delay Causes Dashboard

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes airline delay causes using the **Airline Delay Causes Dataset** from Kaggle.  
It explores overall delay patterns, reasons for delays, and performance across carriers and airports.

## 📂 Data Source
- **Dataset:** Airline Delay Causes  
- **Download:** [Kaggle – Airline Delay Causes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giovamata/airlinedelaycauses)  
- **Connection Mode:** Import  

## 🗂️ Imported Tables
- Flight Delay Data (from Kaggle)  
- Dates Table (created with DAX for time intelligence)  

## 🛠️ Data Transformations
- Cleaned and formatted dataset for readability  
- Created **Dates Table** using DAX  
- Built relationships between delay causes and flight data  
- Removed unused columns and handled missing values  

## 📐 Measures
- Total Delays  
- Percentage of Delays  
- Average Delay Time  
- Delay Count by Cause  
- Delay Duration by Cause  

## 📊 Visualizations
